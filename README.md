This repository contains multiple notebooks to retrieve the following NWM retrospective data:
* NWM hourly simulated streamflow (v2.1, v3.0) and USGS observation at multiple reaches of interest
* NWM precipitation from the grid cell that matches multiple site locations (lat/lon)
* NWM mean areal precipitation (MAP) computed over multiple basins
* NWM snow depth and SWE from the grid cell that matches multiple site locations (lat/lon)

The input folder contains the location of different gages (USGS, UVM, GHCNd, Mesonet, and CoCoRaHs) in selected montate catchments in the NE US.
This information was used to develop a NWM performance assessment over selected montane catchments in the NE US.
