This repository contains multiple notebooks to retrieve the following NWM retrospective data:
* NWM hourly simulated streamflow (v2.1, v3.0) and USGS observation at the reach of interest
* NWM precipitation from the grid cell that matched a site lat/lon location
* NWM mean areal precipitation (MAP) computed over multiple basins
* NWM snow depth and SWE from the grid cell that matched a site lat/lon location

The input folder contains the location of different gages (USGS, UVM, GHCNd, Mesonet, and CoCoRaHs) in selected Montate Catchments in the NE US.
This information was used to develop a NWM performance assessment over montane catchments in the NE US.
